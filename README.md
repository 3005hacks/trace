# Trace!
Trace! is a real-time guessing game where users race to the truth.

## Future Plans
Here's what we are aiming for with Trace!:
* Store all clues and guesses in a relational database
* Have multiple games going on at one time
* Create a leaderboard that stores everyone's scores
* Improve efficiency, UI, etc.

## File Directory
This is some background for the siteâ€™s code and structure.

### HTML Files
* `index.html` is the landing page (where people log in)
* `game_start.html` is the page where people can choose/create a game
* `landing.html` is the page where the game actually happens
* `howto.html` provides information about how to use the app

### CSS Files
* `index.css` is for styling the landing page
* `landing.css` is for styling the page where people play
* `game_start.css` is for styling the page where people choose their game
* `howto.css` is for styling the how to play page

### JavaScript Files
* Note: have meeting to discuss structure of JS files

## Best Practices
### HTML
* These are some things to put short comments for:
  * Large sections of the page (e.g. header, content, footer)
  * Subsections of the page (e.g. info, title, pictures, etc.)
  * Ambiguous divs (to delineate major content sections)
  * Scripts (their purposes may not be apparent)

### CSS
* List rules for each selector alphabetically
* Group the stylings by sections of the page, starting with the most general elements
